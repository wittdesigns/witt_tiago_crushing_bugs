Crushing Bugs for the Drag And Drop Puzzle

That project consists in solve the bugs from the puzzle game, solve the the image pieces stacking on each other and also to make them to change its pieces when the background reference its also replaced, there one extra solution that Was aplied adding a possiblity to drop one piece back to the pieces board, allowing the user to reorganize the pieces to build the image.

## Fixing the Bugs

Bug 01 - To fix that bug the main idea was when a piece its placed at some of the puzzle board that space get locked, that means it will there not going to allow to another peace to be dropped at the same location.

Bug 02 - For that one every time you change the background it need to point to its corresponding blocks, as example image 1 - will going to to load its 4 pieces, when changing the image background it will lead to load its own ones, etc

Bug 03 - after find out the possible solution to bug 1 and 2 there its another solution needed, since now when you completed the puzzle 1 and go to puzzle 2 the pieces already show into the board, so the idea was find a way to  have the possiblity to drop at least one piece back to the pieces board


## PLaying the game

"The game is pretty straightforward - you just have to drop the pieces of the image onto the main board to recreate the picture in the background. If you mess up, just hit the 'RESTART PUZZLE' button to start from scratch. And if you've already filled the board with pieces, you can always drop a piece back onto the pieces board to reorganize and try again."
